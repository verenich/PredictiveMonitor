The aim of the project is to design and evaluate methods for predictive process
monitoring that would strike a balance between the following three dimensions:

- Accuracy – being able to make predictions about a given outcome with relatively high levels of
accuracy (e.g. above 90%) and with a sound statistical foundation to back the predictions.

- Earliness – being able to make predictions as early as possible, as soon as there is enough
information in an uncompleted trace to make a prediction with sufficient confidence.

- Low runtime overhead – being able to make predictions almost instantaneously, with limited
computing resources, over real-scale scenarios.
